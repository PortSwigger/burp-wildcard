<p>This extension provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proxy-like view with search filter capabilities for selected Burp
    sources. Request and response are splitted into separate columns. Request
    without responses are being shown and they are later updated as soon as
    response is received.</li>
    <li>Ability to hijack tabs belonging to other extensions (it is not oficially
    supported by Burp Extensions). For safety reasons, in order to work, this
    feature must be explicitly enabled on Options tab each time extension is
    loaded.</li>
    <li>CSRF Handling mini-extension source (Python) which could be saved as a
    file, customized and loaded into Burp later on. Newly added extension will
    handle application specific CSRF tokens.</li>
</ul>
